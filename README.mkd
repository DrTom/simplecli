simplecli
=========

Utility functions to ease command line application development with
[_node.js_](http://nodejs.org/).  This library aims to be unobtrusive,
simple, minimalistic and easy to use.


Install 
-------

For the time being:

1. install the node package manager [npm](http://npmjs.org/)
3. change into source 
4. issue `npm link`

Usage
------

See the files in the `demo` directory and in particular the tests. 

The option parsing is inspired by
[js-opts](https://bitbucket.org/mazzarelli/js-opts/wiki/Home);
however it is not equivalent. I consider this implementation
a bit more friendly for writing tests because it is possible to
inject an `argv` array as an alternative to use `process.argv`. The
parsing function doesn't preserve any _state_, so you can call it
as many times as you like within a process.


Development
-----------

The source is tiny, straight forward, written in
[CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and
located in the `src` directory.

Tests require the [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) framework.

None of the development dependencies is defined in the npm
package.
